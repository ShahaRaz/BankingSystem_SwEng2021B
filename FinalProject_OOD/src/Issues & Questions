1. In the command pattern:
    do i need to save only Add & Remove product, or also other things like query to display data...? what else??

2. Map:
    do i need to save as TreeMap, so for the entire program we will hold a sorted Sorted Map. if yes, how?????
    or it is enough to hold a hashmap, and everytime the user asks for the products list convert the map to list and sort it?

3. Which data we save?
    If we only save the map of products, than we wont be able to hold the Sales of each product
    if we only save it inside the Customer.purchased products, we won't contain sales to antoninus buyers
